# Food_Recommendation_App

An AI-based Food Recommendation System that helps users choose dishes tailored to taste, dietary restrictions and medical needs. It collects user preferences (cuisine, veg/non-veg, rating threshold), combines food metadata and community ratings, and returns ranked dish suggestions through a simple Streamlit UI. The presentation frames this as a hybrid recommender (content + collaborative filtering) to reduce choice overload and help users make healthier, personalized food decisions.&#x20;

**Architecture & data flow**

* Front end: Streamlit app that collects user input (veg/non-veg, cuisine, desired rating) and displays recommendations.&#x20;
* Data: `food.csv` (food metadata) and `ratings.csv` (user ratings) are merged to create the working dataset.&#x20;
* Pipeline: input → validation/filtering (by cuisine / veg / rating) → recommendation engine → UI. The presentation shows the same three-stage flow (data processing → recommendation engine → user profile manager → UI).

**Algorithms & implementation**

* Collaborative filtering (user-item matrix): ratings pivoted to create a user-by-food matrix filled with zeros for missing values. A CSR sparse matrix is constructed for efficient nearest-neighbour queries.&#x20;
* Nearest Neighbours: scikit-learn `NearestNeighbors` with cosine distance (brute force) is trained on the sparse matrix; recommendations are generated by finding nearest items to a chosen Food\_ID and returning the top N similar items. The app's `food_recommendation` function implements this.&#x20;
* Hybrid approach (described in slides): content-based features + collaborative signals and a weighted combination (presentation suggests e.g., 70% content / 30% collaborative). The code currently implements item-based collaborative KNN; content features can be incorporated to complete the hybrid pipeline.&#x20;

**Tech stack**

* Python, Streamlit (UI), Pandas/NumPy (data), SciPy (sparse matrices), scikit-learn (KNN), Matplotlib/Plotly (visualization), BeautifulSoup for web scraping (data collection). &#x20;

**Value proposition**

* Helps consumers choose food aligned to health goals, allergies, medical conditions, and taste — reduces decision fatigue and supports dietary compliance. The slides emphasize improved health outcomes and personalized guidance.&#x20;

**Target customers & channels**

* Direct to consumer: mobile/web app for health-conscious users, diabetics, people with allergies, diet plans.
* B2B opportunities: partner with restaurants/food delivery platforms to surface personalized menu items; integrate with fitness/health apps or hospital nutrition services.

**Monetization options**

* Freemium: basic recommendations free, premium features (nutrition plans, doctor/dietitian integrations, advanced personalization) paid.
* Commission/partnerships with restaurants or delivery platforms for promoted suggestions.
* Data/insights (aggregated, privacy-preserving) for menu optimization or health research.

**Key business metrics to monitor**

* Precision\@K / Recall\@K (accuracy), CTR on recommended items, conversion rate (order or save), retention, average session length, and time-to-first-relevant-recommendation. Also measure fairness (dietary/medical compliance) and user satisfaction.

 A working proof-of-concept recommender that filters dishes by user inputs and produces item-based collaborative recommendations via Streamlit. The concept and UX are aligned with a hybrid recommender vision described in the slides, but the code currently implements collaborative KNN-based suggestions and basic prefiltering. &#x20;
